# Memory Game Project

Open the `index.html` from your browser in order to start the game, the game will shuffle the cards and start effectively after your first card opening. The timer will start as well as the move counter in order to rate your performance at the end of the game.

The stars will be deleted after a certain number of moves until it reaches one star with 25 moves. If you open two cards, then the cards will be compared to check if there is a match or not. If the two cards match each other ,then they will stay in the opened position otherwise they will return back.

Once all cards are successfully matched, then a popup screen alert will appear with a Congratulation message that will show your time, number of moves, and number of stars.

if you want to start a new game then you can refresh the page or click the restart button.

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).
